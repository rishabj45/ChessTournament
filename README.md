PROMPT GIVEN 

i am beginner working on chesstournament project i will attach zip file of what i had completed if u need any ideas from there; i was using sqlite but use what is bestlike sqlalchemy
initialise the tournament with n teams and 4 players in each team;generates round robin schedule 
the site should be read only for viewers and admin can add information. at top of site tournament name , below it 4 tabs- schedule&results,standings,teams,best player;default schedule page is open
it should also allow admin to login but viewers dont need to login;when admin is logged in it should show a toggle for admin mode which can be turned on off to be in viewer mode and admin mode,can only use admin powers in admin mode
teams tab shows teams and players with their ratings; admin can add upto 2 more players ; change team names player names player ratings; remove player but no . of players cant go below 4 and canot excceed 6 
schedule&results contain date and time of matches and  show result,each match is a 4v4 ;it also shows which player plays against whom on each board ; top4 players by default;if any players is swapped there place in order is decided bt their order in team 
admin can submit results in each board 
standings contain teams rank based on points and tiebraker points also like used in fide tournaments
best player which has all the players ranked based on no. of wins

additional features that we can add later:
assign black and white to teams in each match ; team white gets while in board1,3 black gets white in board 2,4
in case of odd no of rounds i am unsure how to be fair so every team gets white equal times
